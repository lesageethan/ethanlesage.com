            <h2>Web Design Portfolio</h2>
            <p>
                For a long period of time during secondary school and university, I worked as a freelance web developer. 
                The websites I made were primarily for local businesses, but also a couple in Canada and Australia. 
                I no longer do this, but you can see some of the sites I made below. <br><br>
                Please note, some of these sites are far from perfect, as I started when I was just 16. 
                Also, many have since been modified by their owners, and many have expired SSL certificates.
